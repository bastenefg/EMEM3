# EMEM3 - Random walk implementation

This MATLAB implementation outputs a statistically accurate random walk simulation, visually consistent with what can be expected from observing colloids in suspention in a viscous fluid under a microscope. 

The parameters the user can play with are 

1. Time interval between frames (tau)
2. Temperature (T)
3. Fluid viscosity (mu) 
4. Particle diameter (a)
5. Various spatial domain parameters (mm_per_pix, etc.)
6. Number of particles (Npart)
7. Number of iterations (iter)

To output .tif files for each outputs, the user can uncomment lines 57 and 58.
