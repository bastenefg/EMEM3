# EMEM3 - Random walk implementation

This MATLAB implementation outputs a statistically accurate random walk simulation, visually consistent with what can be expected from observing colloids in suspention in a viscous fluid under a microscope. To run the code, download the contents of the repo, place them all in the same folder, and run random_walker.m in MATLAB.

The parameters the user can play with are 

1. Time interval between frames (tau)
2. Temperature (T)
3. Fluid viscosity (mu) 
4. Particle diameter (a)
5. Number of particles (Npart)
6. Number of iterations (iter)
